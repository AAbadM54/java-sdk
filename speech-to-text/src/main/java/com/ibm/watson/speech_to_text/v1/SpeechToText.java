/**
 * The IBM&reg; Speech to Text service provides APIs that use IBM's speech-recognition capabilities to produce
 * transcripts of spoken audio. The service can transcribe speech from various languages and audio formats. In addition
 * to basic transcription, the service can produce detailed information about many different aspects of the audio. For
 * most languages, the service supports two sampling rates, broadband and narrowband. It returns all JSON response
 * content in the UTF-8 character set.
 *
 * For speech recognition, the service supports synchronous and asynchronous HTTP Representational State Transfer (REST)
 * interfaces. It also supports a WebSocket interface that provides a full-duplex, low-latency communication channel:
 * Clients send requests and audio to the service and receive results over a single connection asynchronously.
 *
 * The service also offers two customization interfaces. Use language model customization to expand the vocabulary of a
 * base model with domain-specific terminology. Use acoustic model customization to adapt a base model for the acoustic
 * characteristics of your audio. For language model customization, the service also supports grammars. A grammar is a
 * formal language specification that lets you restrict the phrases that the service can recognize.
 *
 * Language model customization is generally available for production use with most supported languages. Acoustic model
 * customization is beta functionality that is available for all supported languages.
 *
 * @version v1
 * @see <a href="http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html">Speech to Text</a>

  /**
   * Recognize audio.

   * Sends audio and returns transcription results for a recognition request. You can pass a maximum of 100 MB and a
   * minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically detects the endianness of the incoming
   * audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to one-channel mono during transcoding.
   * The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the WebSocket API.
   *
   * **See also:** [Making a basic HTTP
   * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-basic).
   *
   * ### Streaming mode
   *
   * For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
   * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the
   * service receives no data chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server also
   * closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not
   * processing time); use the `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
   *
   * **See also:**
   * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
   * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
   *
   * ### Audio formats (content types)
   *
   * The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
   * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
   * format of the audio.
   * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
   * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
   * either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
   *
   * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
   * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
   * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/flac`
   * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
   * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/mp3`
   * * `audio/mpeg`
   * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
   * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
   * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
   *
   * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
   * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
   * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
   * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
   *
   * **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
   *
   * ### Multipart speech recognition
   *
   * **Note:** The Watson SDKs do not support multipart speech recognition.
   *
   * The HTTP `POST` method of the service also supports multipart speech recognition. With multipart requests, you pass
   * all audio data as multipart form data. You specify some parameters as request headers and query parameters, but you
   * pass JSON metadata as form data to control most aspects of the transcription.
   *
   * The multipart approach is intended for use with browsers for which JavaScript is disabled or when the parameters
   * used with the request are greater than the 8 KB limit imposed by most HTTP servers and proxies. You can encounter
   * this limit, for example, if you want to spot a very large number of keywords.
   *
   * **See also:** [Making a multipart HTTP
   * request](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/http.html#HTTP-multi).

   * service manually even if you include a callback URL. In both cases, you can include the `results_ttl` parameter to
   * specify how long the results are to remain available after the job is complete. Using the HTTPS **Check a job**
   * method to retrieve results is more secure than receiving them via callback notification over HTTP because it
   * provides confidentiality in addition to authentication and data integrity.
   *
   * The method supports the same basic parameters as other HTTP and WebSocket recognition requests. It also supports
   * the following parameters specific to the asynchronous interface:
   * * `callback_url`
   * * `events`
   * * `user_token`
   * * `results_ttl`
   *
   * You can pass a maximum of 100 MB and a minimum of 100 bytes of audio with a request. The service automatically
   * detects the endianness of the incoming audio and, for audio that includes multiple channels, downmixes the audio to
   * one-channel mono during transcoding. The method returns only final results; to enable interim results, use the
   * WebSocket API.
   *
   * **See also:** [Creating a job](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/async.html#create).
   *
   * ### Streaming mode
   *
   * For requests to transcribe live audio as it becomes available, you must set the `Transfer-Encoding` header to
   * `chunked` to use streaming mode. In streaming mode, the server closes the connection (status code 408) if the
   * service receives no data chunk for 30 seconds and it has no audio to transcribe for 30 seconds. The server also
   * closes the connection (status code 400) if no speech is detected for `inactivity_timeout` seconds of audio (not
   * processing time); use the `inactivity_timeout` parameter to change the default of 30 seconds.
   *
   * **See also:**
   * * [Audio transmission](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#transmission)
   * * [Timeouts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/input.html#timeouts)
   *
   * ### Audio formats (content types)
   *
   * The service accepts audio in the following formats (MIME types).
   * * For formats that are labeled **Required**, you must use the `Content-Type` header with the request to specify the
   * format of the audio.
   * * For all other formats, you can omit the `Content-Type` header or specify `application/octet-stream` with the
   * header to have the service automatically detect the format of the audio. (With the `curl` command, you can specify
   * either `\"Content-Type:\"` or `\"Content-Type: application/octet-stream\"`.)
   *
   * Where indicated, the format that you specify must include the sampling rate and can optionally include the number
   * of channels and the endianness of the audio.
   * * `audio/basic` (**Required.** Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/flac`
   * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/l16` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`)
   * and endianness (`endianness`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/mp3`
   * * `audio/mpeg`
   * * `audio/mulaw` (**Required.** Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
   * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
   * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
   *
   * The sampling rate of the audio must match the sampling rate of the model for the recognition request: for broadband
   * models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is higher than
   * the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling rate of the
   * audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the request fails.
   *
   * **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).

   * the callback URL. The service passes a random alphanumeric challenge string via the `challenge_string` parameter of
   * the request. The request includes an `Accept` header that specifies `text/plain` as the required response type.
   *
   * To be registered successfully, the callback URL must respond to the `GET` request from the service. The response
   * must send status code 200 and must include the challenge string in its body. Set the `Content-Type` response header
   * to `text/plain`. Upon receiving this response, the service responds to the original registration request with

   *

   * multiple corpus text files. You must use credentials for the instance of the service that owns a model to add a
   * corpus to it. Adding a corpus does not affect the custom language model until you train the model for the new data
   * by using the **Train a custom language model** method.
   *
   * Submit a plain text file that contains sample sentences from the domain of interest to enable the service to
   * extract words in context. The more sentences you add that represent the context in which speakers use words from
   * the domain, the better the service's recognition accuracy.
   *
   * The call returns an HTTP 201 response code if the corpus is valid. The service then asynchronously processes the
   * contents of the corpus and automatically extracts new words that it finds. This can take on the order of a minute
   * or two to complete depending on the total number of words and the number of new words in the corpus, as well as the
   * current load on the service. You cannot submit requests to add additional resources to the custom model or to train
   * the model until the service's analysis of the corpus for the current request completes. Use the **List a corpus**
   * method to check the status of the analysis.
   *
   * The service auto-populates the model's words resource with words from the corpus that are not found in its base
   * vocabulary. These are referred to as out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words. You can use the **List custom words** method to
   * examine the words resource. You can use other words method to eliminate typos and modify how words are pronounced
   * as needed.
   *
   * To add a corpus file that has the same name as an existing corpus, set the `allow_overwrite` parameter to `true`;
   * otherwise, the request fails. Overwriting an existing corpus causes the service to process the corpus text file and
   * extract OOV words anew. Before doing so, it removes any OOV words associated with the existing corpus from the
   * model's words resource unless they were also added by another corpus or grammar, or they have been modified in some
   * way with the **Add custom words** or **Add a custom word** method.
   *
   * The service limits the overall amount of data that you can add to a custom model to a maximum of 10 million total
   * words from all sources combined. Also, you can add no more than 30 thousand custom (OOV) words to a model. This
   * includes words that the service extracts from corpora and grammars, and words that you add directly.

  /**
   * Add an audio resource.
   *
   * Adds an audio resource to a custom acoustic model. Add audio content that reflects the acoustic characteristics of

   * to add an audio resource to it. Adding audio data does not affect the custom acoustic model until you train the
   * model for the new data by using the **Train a custom acoustic model** method.
   *
   * You can add individual audio files or an archive file that contains multiple audio files. Adding multiple audio
   * files via a single archive file is significantly more efficient than adding each file individually. You can add
   * audio resources in any format that the service supports for speech recognition.
   *
   * You can use this method to add any number of audio resources to a custom model by calling the method once for each
   * audio or archive file. But the addition of one audio resource must be fully complete before you can add another.
   * You must add a minimum of 10 minutes and a maximum of 100 hours of audio that includes speech, not just silence, to
   * a custom acoustic model before you can train it. No audio resource, audio- or archive-type, can be larger than 100
   * MB. To add an audio resource that has the same name as an existing audio resource, set the `allow_overwrite`
   * parameter to `true`; otherwise, the request fails.
   *
   * The method is asynchronous. It can take several seconds to complete depending on the duration of the audio and, in
   * the case of an archive file, the total number of audio files being processed. The service returns a 201 response
   * code if the audio is valid. It then asynchronously analyzes the contents of the audio file or files and
   * automatically extracts information about the audio such as its length, sampling rate, and encoding. You cannot
   * submit requests to add additional audio resources to a custom acoustic model, or to train the model, until the
   * service's analysis of all audio files for the current request completes.
   *
   * To determine the status of the service's analysis of the audio, use the **Get an audio resource** method to poll
   * the status of the audio. The method accepts the customization ID of the custom model and the name of the audio
   * resource, and it returns the status of the resource. Use a loop to check the status of the audio every few seconds
   * until it becomes `ok`.
   *
   * **See also:** [Add audio to the custom acoustic
   * model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/acoustic-create.html#addAudio).
   *
   * ### Content types for audio-type resources
   *
   * You can add an individual audio file in any format that the service supports for speech recognition. For an
   * audio-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify the audio format (MIME type) of the audio file,
   * including specifying the sampling rate, channels, and endianness where indicated.
   * * `audio/basic` (Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/flac`
   * * `audio/g729` (Use only with narrowband models.)
   * * `audio/l16` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) and optionally the number of channels (`channels`) and endianness
   * (`endianness`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/mp3`
   * * `audio/mpeg`
   * * `audio/mulaw` (Specify the sampling rate (`rate`) of the audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/ogg;codecs=vorbis`
   * * `audio/wav` (Provide audio with a maximum of nine channels.)
   * * `audio/webm` (The service automatically detects the codec of the input audio.)
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=opus`
   * * `audio/webm;codecs=vorbis`
   *
   * The sampling rate of an audio file must match the sampling rate of the base model for the custom model: for
   * broadband models, at least 16 kHz; for narrowband models, at least 8 kHz. If the sampling rate of the audio is
   * higher than the minimum required rate, the service down-samples the audio to the appropriate rate. If the sampling
   * rate of the audio is lower than the minimum required rate, the service labels the audio file as `invalid`.
   *
   * **See also:** [Audio formats](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/speech-to-text/audio-formats.html).
   *
   * ### Content types for archive-type resources
   *
   * You can add an archive file (**.zip** or **.tar.gz** file) that contains audio files in any format that the
   * service supports for speech recognition. For an archive-type resource, use the `Content-Type` parameter to specify
   * the media type of the archive file:
   * * `application/zip` for a **.zip** file
   * * `application/gzip` for a **.tar.gz** file.
   *
   * All audio files contained in the archive must have the same audio format. Use the `Contained-Content-Type`
   * parameter to specify the format of the contained audio files. The parameter accepts all of the audio formats
   * supported for use with speech recognition and with the `Content-Type` header, including the `rate`, `channels`, and
   * `endianness` parameters that are used with some formats. The default contained audio format is `audio/wav`.
   *
   * ### Naming restrictions for embedded audio files
   *
   * The name of an audio file that is embedded within an archive-type resource must meet the following restrictions:
   * * Include a maximum of 128 characters in the file name; this includes the file extension.
   * * Do not include spaces, slashes, or backslashes in the file name.
   * * Do not use the name of an audio file that has already been added to the custom model as part of an archive-type
   * resource.
