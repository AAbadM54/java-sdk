###### Gradle

Add repository to your project Gradle file

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
    }
}
```

```

##### JAR

Download the jar with dependencies [here][jar].

Now, you are ready to see some [examples](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/java-sdk/tree/master/examples/src/main/java/com/ibm/watson/developer_cloud).

## Usage

The examples within each service assume that you already have service credentials. If not,
you will have to [create a service](#getting-credentials) in IBM Cloud.

If you are running your application in IBM Cloud (or other platforms based on Cloud Foundry), you don't need to specify the
credentials; the library will get them for you by looking at the [`VCAP_SERVICES`][vcap_services] environment variable.

## Running in IBM Cloud

When running in IBM Cloud (or other platforms based on Cloud Foundry), the library will automatically get the credentials from [`VCAP_SERVICES`][vcap_services].
If you have more than one plan, you can use `CredentialUtils` to get the service credentials for an specific plan.

## Authentication

Watson services are migrating to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

- With some service instances, you authenticate to the API by using **[IAM](#iam)**.
- In other instances, you authenticate by providing the **[username and password](#username-and-password)** for the service instance.

**Note:** Previously, it was possible to authenticate using a token in a header called `X-Watson-Authorization-Token`. This method is deprecated. The token continues to work with Cloud Foundry services, but is not supported for services that use Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. See [here](#iam) for details.

### Getting credentials

To find out which authentication to use, view the service credentials. You find the service credentials for authentication the same way for all Watson services:

1.  Go to the IBM Cloud [Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/) page.
1.  Either click an existing Watson service instance in your [resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources) or click [**Create resource > AI**](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?category=ai) and create a service instance.
1. Click on the **Manage** item in the left nav bar of your service instance.

On this page, you should be able to see your credentials for accessing your service instance.

In your code, you can use these values in the service constructor or with a method call after instantiating your service.

### Supplying credentials

There are two ways to supply the credentials you found above to the SDK for authentication.

#### Credential file (easier!)

With a credential file, you just need to put the file in the right place and the SDK will do the work of parsing it and authenticating. You can get this file by clicking the **Download** button for the credentials in the **Manage** tab of your service instance.

The file downloaded will be called `ibm-credentials.env`. This is the name the SDK will search for and **must** be preserved unless you want to configure the file path (more on that later). The SDK will look for your `ibm-credentials.env` file in the following places (in order):

- Your system's home directory
- The top-level directory of the project you're using the SDK in

As long as you set that up correctly, you don't have to worry about setting any authentication options in your code. So, for example, if you created and downloaded the credential file for your Discovery instance, you just need to do the following:

```java
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");
```

And that's it!

If you're using more than one service at a time in your code and get two different `ibm-credentials.env` files, just put the contents together in one `ibm-credentials.env` file and the SDK will handle assigning credentials to their appropriate services.

If you would like to configure the location/name of your credential file, you can set an environment variable called `IBM_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. **This will take precedence over the locations specified above.** Here's how you can do that:

```bash
export IBM_CREDENTIALS_FILE="<path>"
```

where `<path>` is something like `/home/user/Downloads/<file_name>.env`.

#### Manually

If you'd prefer to set authentication values manually in your code, the SDK supports that as well. The way you'll do this depends on what type of credentials your service instance gives you.

##### IAM

Some services use token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication. IAM authentication uses a service API key to get an access token that is passed with the call. Access tokens are valid for approximately one hour and must be regenerated.

You supply either an IAM service **API key** or an **access token**:

- Use the API key to have the SDK manage the lifecycle of the access token. The SDK requests an access token, ensures that the access token is valid, and refreshes it if necessary.
- Use the access token if you want to manage the lifecycle yourself. For details, see [Authenticating with IAM tokens](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/watson/getting-started-iam.html). If you want to switch to API key, override your stored IAM credentials with an IAM API key. Then call the `setIamCredentials()` method again.


Supplying the IAM API key:

```java
// in the constructor, letting the SDK manage the IAM token
IamOptions options = new IamOptions.Builder()
  .apiKey("<iam_api_key>")
  .url("<iam_url>") // optional - the default value is https://iam.bluemix.net/identity/token
  .build();
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07", options);
```

```java
// after instantiation, letting the SDK manage the IAM token
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");
IamOptions options = new IamOptions.Builder()
  .apiKey("<iam_api_key>")
  .build();
service.setIamCredentials(options);
```

Supplying the access token:

```java
// in the constructor, assuming control of managing IAM token
IamOptions options = new IamOptions.Builder()
  .accessToken("<access_token>")
  .build();
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07", options);
```

```java
// after instantiation, assuming control of managing IAM token
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");
IamOptions options = new IamOptions.Builder()
  .accessToken("<access_token>")
  .build();
service.setIamCredentials(options);
```

#### Username and password

```java
// in the constructor
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07", "<username>", "<password>");
```

```java
// after instantiation
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");
service.setUsernameAndPassword("<username>", "<password>");
```

## Android

The Android SDK utilizes the Java SDK while making some Android-specific additions. This repository can be found [here](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/android-sdk). It depends on [OkHttp][] and [gson][].

## Configuring the HTTP client

The HTTP client can be configured by using the `configureClient()` method on your service object, passing in an `HttpConfigOptions` object. Currently, the following options are supported:
- Disabling SSL verification (only do this if you really mean to!) ⚠️
- Using a proxy (more info here: [OkHTTPClient Proxy authentication how to?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35567936/456564))

Here's an example of setting both of the above:

```java
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");

// setting configuration options
HttpConfigOptions options = new HttpConfigOptions.Builder()
  .disableSslVerification(true)
  .proxy(new Proxy(Proxy.Type.HTTP, new InetSocketAddress("proxyHost", 8080)))
  .build();

service.configureClient(options);
```

## Sending request headers

Custom headers can be passed with any request. To do so, add the header to the `ServiceCall` object before executing the request. For example, this is what it looks like to send the header `Custom-Header` along with a call to the Watson Assistant service:

```java
WorkspaceCollection workspaces = service.listWorkspaces()
  .addHeader("Custom-Header", "custom_value")
  .execute();
```

## Parsing HTTP response info

The basic `execute()`, `enqueue()`, and `rx()` methods make HTTP requests to your Watson service and return models based on the requested endpoint. If you would like access to some HTTP response information along with the response model, you can use the more detailed versions of those three methods: `executeWithDetails()`, `enqueueWithDetails()`, and `rxWithDetails()`. To capture the responses, use the new `Response<T>` class, with `T` being the expected response model.

Here is an example of calling the Watson Assistant `listWorkspaces()` method and parsing its response model as well as the response headers:

```java
Response<WorkspaceCollection> response = service.listWorkspaces().executeWithDetails();

// getting result equivalent to execute()
WorkspaceCollection workspaces = response.getResult();

// getting returned HTTP headers
Headers responseHeaders = response.getHeaders();
```

Note that when using `enqueueWithDetails()`, you must also implement the new `ServiceCallbackWithDetails` interface. For example:

```java
service.listWorkspaces().enqueueWithDetails(new ServiceCallbackWithDetails<WorkspaceCollection>() {
  @Override
  public void onResponse(Response<WorkspaceCollection> response) {
    WorkspaceCollection workspaces = response.getResult();
    Headers responseHeaders = response.getHeaders();
  }

  @Override
  public void onFailure(Exception e) { }
});
```

## Default headers

Default headers can be specified at any time by using the `setDefaultHeaders(Map<String, String> headers)` method.

The example below sends the `X-Watson-Learning-Opt-Out` header in every request preventing Watson from using the payload to improve the service.

```java
PersonalityInsights service = new PersonalityInsights("2016-10-19");

Map<String, String> headers = new HashMap<String, String>();
headers.put(HttpHeaders.X_WATSON_LEARNING_OPT_OUT, "true");

service.setDefaultHeaders(headers);

// All the api calls from now on will send the default headers
```

## Specifying a service URL

You can set the correct API endpoint for your service calling `setEndPoint()`.

For example, if you have the Discovery service in Germany, the endpoint may be `https://gateway-fra.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api`.

You will need to call

```java
Discovery service = new Discovery("2017-11-07");
service.sentEndPoint("https://gateway-fra.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api")
```

## 401 unauthorized error

Make sure you are using the service credentials and not your IBM Cloud account/password.
Check the API endpoint, you may need to update the default using `setEndPoint()`.

## Debug

HTTP requests can be logged by adding a `logging.properties` file to your classpath.

```none
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINE
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=%1$tb %1$td, %1$tY %1$tl:%1$tM:%1$tS %1$Tp %2$s %4$s: %5$s%n
.level=SEVERE
# HTTP Logging - Basic
com.ibm.watson.developer_cloud.util.HttpLogging.level=INFO
```

The configuration above will log only the URL and query parameters for each request.

For example:

```none
Mar 30, 2017 7:31:22 PM okhttp3.internal.platform.Platform log
INFO: --> POST https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tradeoff-analytics/api/v1/dilemmas?generate_visualization=false http/1.1 (923-byte body)
Mar 30, 2017 7:31:22 PM okhttp3.internal.platform.Platform log
INFO: <-- 200 OK https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tradeoff-analytics/api/v1/dilemmas?generate_visualization=false (104ms, unknown-length body)
Mar 30, 2017 7:31:23 PM okhttp3.internal.platform.Platform log
INFO: --> POST https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tradeoff-analytics/api/v1/dilemmas?generate_visualization=true http/1.1 (12398-byte body)
Mar 30, 2017 7:31:35 PM okhttp3.internal.platform.Platform log
INFO: <-- 200 OK https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tradeoff-analytics/api/v1/dilemmas?generate_visualization=true (12311ms, unknown-length body)
```

**Warning:** The logs generated by this logger when using the level `FINE` or `ALL` has the potential to leak sensitive information such as "Authorization" or "Cookie" headers and the contents of request and response bodies. This data should only be logged in a controlled way or in a non-production environment.

## Build + test

To build and test the project you can use [Gradle][] (version 1.x).

Gradle:

```sh
cd java-sdk
gradle jar  # build jar file (build/libs/watson-developer-cloud-6.14.0.jar)
gradle test # run tests
gradle check # performs quality checks on source files and generates reports
gradle testReport # run tests and generate the aggregated test report (build/reports/allTests)
gradle codeCoverageReport # run tests and generate the code coverage report (build/reports/jacoco)
```

## Working with Eclipse and Intellij IDEA

If you want to work on the code in an IDE instead of a text editor you can
easily create project files with gradle:

```sh
gradle idea     # Intellij IDEA
gradle eclipse  # Eclipse
```
